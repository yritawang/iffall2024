            <p>Drivin' on the right-side road</p>
            <p>He says I'm pretty wearin' his clothes</p>
            <p>And he's got hands that make Hell seem cold</p>
            <p>Feet on the dashboard, he's like a poem I wish I wrote</p>
            <p>I wish I wrote</p>
            <br>
            <p>And he laughs at all my joke</p>
            <p>And he says I'm so American            </p>
            <p>Oh, God, it's just not fair of him</p>
            <p>To make me feel this much</p>
            <p>I'd go anywhere he goes</p>
            <p>And he says I'm so American</p>
            <p>Oh, God, I'm gonna marry him</p>
            <p>I might just be in lo-lo-, lo-lo-, lo-lo-, lo-lo-lo-lo-love</p>
            <br>
            <p>God I'm so boring, and I'm so rude</p>
            <p>Can't have a conversation if it's not all about you</p>
            <p>The way you dress, and the books you read</p>
            <p>I really love my bed, but, man, it's hard to sleep when he's with me</p>
            <p>When he's with me</p>
            <br>
            <p>And he laughs at all my joke</p>
            <p>And he says I'm so American            </p>
            <p>Oh, God, it's just not fair of him</p>
            <p>To make me feel this much</p>
            <p>I'd go anywhere he goes</p>
            <p>And he says I'm so American</p>
            <p>Oh, God, I'm gonna marry him</p>
            <p>I might just be in lo-lo-, lo-lo-, lo-lo-, lo-lo-lo-lo-love</p>
            <br>
            <p>I apologize if it's a little too much, just a little too soon</p>
            <p>But if the conversation ever were to come up</p>
            <p>I don't wanna assume this stuff</p>
            <p>But ain't it love?</p>
            <p>I think I'm in love</p>
            <br>
            <p>And he laughs at all my joke</p>
            <p>And he says I'm so American</p>
            <p>Oh, God, it's just not fair of him</p>
            <p>To make me feel this much</p>
            <p>I'd go anywhere he goes</p>
            <p>And he says I'm so American</p>
            <p>Oh, God, I'm gonna marry him</p>
            <p>I might just be in lo-lo-, lo-lo-, lo-lo-, lo-lo-lo-lo-love</p>
            <br>
            <p>Okay</p>
            <p>Stop it</p>
            <p>Come on</p>
            <p>Ah</p>
            <p>Ah</p>
            <br>
