                    <h3>Recipe Page</h3>
                    <p>I made my recipe page on Chinese Cucumber Salad. I didn't quite understand how to deal with responsible design so I didn't code that into my css. I focused mainly on making the grid instructions for the special cutting cucumber sequence.</p>

                    <h3>Microsite: Designer</h3>
                </a>
                <p>I designed the microsite about Inside Out in partnership with Amber Edmonds. I helped her excute her vision of creating an environment that is similar to the movie's color theme.</p>

                    <h3>Microsite: Art Director</h3>
                    <p>Christine Jung designed this website under my instruction. I wanted to communicate the movie's stylistic choices and I think she did a great job incoporating the "postcard" vintage look.</p>
